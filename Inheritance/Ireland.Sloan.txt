1. Which notes and examples from class were helpful for completing the classwork?
The notes and particularly the diagrams for the concept of using the Super()
constructor to get constructors and private variables from the parent or superclass
above in the hierarchy. Having the examples made it pretty clear what to do when
the description of just the concept was still confusing. Also the note to
about the this.varname syntax was very helpful as I would have a very long time\
trying to figure it out.
2. If you didn't complete the classwork: What would have helped you complete the classwork today?
The only part that we didn't finish was fully analyzing why the example that called
the subclass and then the superclass produced an error. I am not sure what would
have helped speed things up. Felt pretty good about the flow for the classwork.
